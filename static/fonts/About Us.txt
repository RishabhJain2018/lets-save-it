We are team "Anonymous" of JSS-Hackathon 2015. We started developing this project keeping in mind about Energy Conservation and how we can help contribute towards environment. We aimed at sustainable development and reducing environmental pollution too. The whole program will help reduce electricity consumption and its wastage, thus ensuring existence of fossil fuels (primary source of production of electricity) over longer period of time. Hence, it will help reduce environmental pollution that are generated during the production of Electric Energy.
